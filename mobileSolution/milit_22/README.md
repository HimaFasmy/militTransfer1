Steganography is the technique of concealing a confidential message within a bigger message, such as an image or audio file, in such a way that it is not easily detectable to an observer. It should be noted that Steganography is distinct from Encryption, which involves converting a message into an unreadable format, with the aim of preventing unauthorized parties from deciphering it, but does not conceal the fact that a message has been sent.
